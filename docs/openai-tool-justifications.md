## OPEN WORLD TOOLS (4 tools — trigger external communication)

### send_invoice

| Field | Justification |
|-------|---------------|
| **Read Only: No** | This tool triggers sending an invoice to the client via email and updates the invoice status to sent. |
| **Open World: Yes** | This tool causes Frihet's transactional email service to deliver the invoice PDF to the client's stored email address. An email is sent to an external recipient. |
| **Destructive: No** | The invoice data is preserved. While the email delivery cannot be recalled, the invoice can be updated or credit-noted afterward. |

### send_quote

| Field | Justification |
|-------|---------------|
| **Read Only: No** | This tool triggers sending a quote to the client via email and updates the quote status to sent. |
| **Open World: Yes** | This tool causes Frihet's transactional email service to deliver the quote to the client's stored email address. An email is sent to an external recipient. |
| **Destructive: No** | The quote data is preserved. While the email delivery cannot be recalled, the quote can be updated afterward. |

### create_webhook

| Field | Justification |
|-------|---------------|
| **Read Only: No** | This tool creates a new webhook configuration that subscribes to business events. |
| **Open World: Yes** | This tool configures Frihet to send HTTP POST requests to a user-specified external URL when subscribed business events occur (e.g. invoice.created, invoice.paid). Event data is sent to the external endpoint. |
| **Destructive: No** | This tool creates a new configuration. It does not delete existing data. The webhook can be deactivated or deleted later. |

### update_webhook

| Field | Justification |
|-------|---------------|
| **Read Only: No** | This tool modifies an existing webhook configuration (URL, events, active status). |
| **Open World: Yes** | This tool can change the external URL that receives webhook notifications from Frihet, redirecting event data to a different external endpoint. |
| **Destructive: No** | This tool modifies configuration but does not delete it. Changes are reversible by updating again. |
