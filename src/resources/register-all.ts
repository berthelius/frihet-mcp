const INVOICE_STATUSES = `Frihet Invoice Status Flow
===========================

Statuses and transitions:

  DRAFT ──────► SENT ──────► PAID
    │             │
    │             └──────► OVERDUE ────► PAID
    │                         │
    │                         └────────► CANCELLED
    │
    └─────────────────────────────────► CANCELLED

Status definitions:

  draft     — Invoice created but not yet sent to client.
              Can be freely edited. No fiscal implications yet.
              This is the default status for new invoices.

  sent      — Invoice delivered to the client (email, PDF, etc.).
              Payment is expected. The invoice number and date become
              fiscally relevant — avoid modifications after this point.

  paid      — Payment received in full. Terminal state.
              Records the payment date. Invoice is complete.

  overdue   — Payment deadline (dueDate) has passed without payment.
              Triggers follow-up workflows. Can transition to paid
              (late payment) or cancelled (write-off / bad debt).

  cancelled — Invoice voided. Requires a corrective invoice or
              credit note for fiscal compliance if previously sent.
              Terminal state. Cannot transition to other statuses.

Automation rules (when configured):
  - Auto-transition sent → overdue when dueDate passes (daily check)
  - Webhook events: invoice.created, invoice.sent, invoice.paid,
    invoice.overdue, invoice.cancelled
  - Overdue reminders can be configured per-client

Best practices:
  - Always set a dueDate when creating invoices (default: 30 days)
  - Use draft status while iterating with the client
  - Once sent, create a new corrective invoice rather than editing
  - For partial payments, keep status as sent until full payment
  - cancelled requires a reason (notes field) for audit trail`;
