> **DO NOT SUBMIT anything here without Viktor's explicit OK.**
> Each `SUBMISSION.md` file is a complete, copy-paste-ready package — not a trigger to submit.

## Recommended Submission Order

**1. Cursor (submit first)**
- Fastest review cycle, community-driven
- Lower technical bar (no OAuth domain verification required)
- Use as messaging test run before higher-stakes submissions
- URL: https://cursor.com/marketplace/publish
- Also submit in parallel to cursor.directory/mcp and mcpcursor.com (community directories, instant)

**2. OpenAI ChatGPT Apps (submit second)**
- Requires domain verification token deployed to Worker BEFORE submitting
- OAuth must include `code_challenge_methods_supported: ["S256"]`
- Test full OAuth flow in Developer Mode first
- URL: https://chatgpt.com → Settings → Developer Mode → "Create App"

**3. Anthropic Claude Directory (submit last)**
- ~2 week review cycle
- Strictest requirements: production-ready, full OAuth, tool annotations, privacy policy live
- Requires `-beta` version dropped OR explicitly noted
- URL: https://claude.ai/settings/connectors
- Submission form: https://claude.com/docs/connectors/building/submission
