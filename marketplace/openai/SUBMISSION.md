### Section 2 — MCP Server Configuration

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| MCP server URL | `https://mcp.frihet.io/mcp` |
| Transport type | `streamable-http` |
| Authentication type | OAuth 2.0 + PKCE |
| Authorization endpoint | `https://mcp.frihet.io/oauth/authorize` |
| Token endpoint | `https://mcp.frihet.io/oauth/token` |
| Scopes | `read write` |

**Required: Add OpenAI's redirect URI to your OAuth config before submitting.**
OpenAI's callback URL (exact value provided during submission — add it alongside existing claude.ai callbacks).

---

### Section 3 — Domain Verification

OpenAI verifies domain ownership before publishing. The verification flow:

1. OpenAI provides a token (e.g., `abc123xyz789`) during submission
2. You must serve it at: `GET https://mcp.frihet.io/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge`
3. Response must be **plain text** (not JSON, not HTML) — just the token string
4. OpenAI pings immediately on form submission — deploy the file BEFORE clicking submit

**Current `.well-known` routes on `mcp.frihet.io` Worker:**

The Worker already serves `.well-known/mcp`, `.well-known/ai.txt`. Add `openai-apps-challenge` route BEFORE submitting:

```typescript
// In the Cloudflare Worker (wrangler.toml / src/index.ts), add:
if (url.pathname === '/.well-known/openai-apps-challenge') {
  return new Response('OPENAI_TOKEN_GOES_HERE', {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' }
  });
}
```

Replace `OPENAI_TOKEN_GOES_HERE` with the actual token OpenAI provides during submission. Deploy to Cloudflare before clicking submit.

**Alternative:** If `mcp.frihet.io` serves from a subpath (e.g., `/mcp`), OpenAI's domain verification may require the challenge at the root domain. Note: OpenAI has a known limitation with subpath-hosted servers — file a support request if domain verification fails.

---

### Section 4 — OAuth Technical Requirements

OpenAI enforces strict OAuth 2.1 compliance. Verify before submitting:

**Required in authorization server metadata (`/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`):**
```json
{
  "code_challenge_methods_supported": ["S256"],
  "response_types_supported": ["code"],
  "grant_types_supported": ["authorization_code"],
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": ["none"]
}
```

**Critical:** If `code_challenge_methods_supported` is missing or doesn't include `S256`, ChatGPT will reject the OAuth flow with "unsupported OAuth config type". This is a hard block.

**OpenAI's OAuth state parameter** is 400+ chars of base64-encoded JSON. Ensure the OAuth state handler on `mcp.frihet.io` accepts long state values (no length truncation).

---

### Section 5 — Branding & Assets

| Asset | Path | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| App icon (512×512 PNG) | `~/Documents/Frihet-Saas-Website/public/favicon.svg` | Export to PNG 512×512 |
| Hero image (1280×720) | `~/Documents/Frihet-Saas-Website/public/banners/frihet-banner-business-og.png` | Business-focused |
| LinkedIn banner | `~/Documents/Frihet-Saas-Website/public/banners/frihet-banner-business-linkedin.png` | Business audience |

**Screenshots to prepare (Viktor action required):**
1. ChatGPT: `"Show me all unpaid invoices"` → structured table response
2. ChatGPT: `"Create an invoice for Acme SL, 5 hours consulting at 100/h"` → invoice created
3. ChatGPT: `"What's my tax liability for Q1 2026 — Modelo 303?"` → fiscal breakdown
4. ChatGPT: `"Log a 89 EUR expense for Adobe CC, category software"` → expense logged

---

### Section 6 — Compliance & Privacy

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Data storage | Per-request only — no persistent storage of user data server-side |
| Data residency | EU (europe-west1) |
| GDPR | Yes — see `https://frihet.io/legal/privacy` |
| PII handling | API key / Bearer token transmitted in headers only. No PII logged. |
| EU users | Yes — primary market (Spain + EU) |

---

## Test Account (required for OpenAI review)

OpenAI reviewers will test the app end-to-end using OAuth flow:
- Create a test account at `https://app.frihet.io`
- Ensure it has: 2–3 clients, 3–5 invoices (mix of paid/unpaid/overdue), 5 expenses
- Include credentials in the submission form under "Test account"

## Pre-Submission Testing in Developer Mode

Test the full flow in ChatGPT before submitting:
1. Go to https://chatgpt.com → Settings → Developer Mode → "Create App"
2. Paste MCP URL: `https://mcp.frihet.io/mcp`
3. Complete OAuth flow (should redirect to `mcp.frihet.io/oauth/authorize` → Frihet login → back to ChatGPT)
4. Test 5 representative tools: `list_invoices`, `create_invoice`, `list_expenses`, `get_business_context`, `get_quarterly_taxes`
5. Verify structured JSON responses, not prose
6. Only submit after all 5 pass

## Submission Order Recommendation

Submit OpenAI **second** — after Cursor (faster, lower bar) but before Anthropic (longest review). OAuth domain verification adds complexity; allow 1–2 days for preparation.

See `../README.md` for full submission sequencing.
